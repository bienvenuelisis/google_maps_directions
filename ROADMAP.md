# RoadMap of package features

## Discussed

1. Add a native method to encode points to Polylines & decode polylines to points (like this package who is unmaintained at this stage : [https://github.com/marchdev-tk/google_polyline_algorithm](https://github.com/marchdev-tk/google_polyline_algorithm)). Can be useful to add it as a getter to the DirectionRoute model.
